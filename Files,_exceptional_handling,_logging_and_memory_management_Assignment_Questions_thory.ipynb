        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages?\n",
        " - Interpreted languages run the code line by line, while compiled languages translate the entire code into machine language before execution. Interpreted languages are more flexible, while compiled ones offer faster performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Exception handling in Python allows the program to catch and respond to errors during execution using blocks like try, except, else, and finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The finally block is used to define code that should always run, whether or not an exception was raised, usually for cleanup tasks like closing files.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python?\n",
        " - Logging is a way to record messages about the program’s execution. It helps in tracking errors, debugging, and monitoring the flow of a program.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the del method in Python?\n",
        "  - The del method is a destructor that gets called when an object is about to be deleted. It is used to release resources like memory or files.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
        "  - import brings in the entire module, requiring access via the module name. from ... import brings specific parts directly into the namespace for simpler access.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python?\n",
        " - Multiple exceptions can be handled by using multiple except blocks or by grouping exceptions in a tuple in a single except block.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python?\n",
        "  - The with statement ensures that a file is properly opened and closed. It handles resource management automatically, even if an error occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing?\n",
        "  - Multithreading runs tasks within the same process and memory space, while multiprocessing creates separate processes with independent memory, ideal for CPU-intensive tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program?\n",
        "  - Logging helps in debugging, monitoring, and understanding a program’s behavior. It records messages for developers without interrupting program flow.\n",
        "\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python?\n",
        " - Memory management in Python involves allocating and releasing memory to objects automatically using techniques like reference counting and garbage collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python?\n",
        "  - Wrap risky code in a try block, handle errors with except, optionally use else if no errors occur, and finally for code that should always run.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python?\n",
        "  - Good memory management ensures efficient use of system resources, prevents memory leaks, and keeps programs stable and fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling?\n",
        " - The try block contains code that may cause an error. If an error occurs, the except block runs to handle it without crashing the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work?\n",
        " - Python automatically deletes objects that are no longer needed using reference counting and cycle detection to reclaim memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling?\n",
        " - The else block runs code only if the try block did not raise an exception. It is useful for logic that should only run if no error occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python?\n",
        " - The main logging levels are DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, and CRITICAL. They indicate the severity of messages logged by the program.\n",
        "\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python?\n",
        " - os.fork() is a low-level Unix function for creating processes. multiprocessing is a Python module that offers a high-level API and works cross-platform.\n",
        "\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python?\n",
        " - Closing a file releases system resources and ensures all data is written properly. Not closing files can lead to memory leaks or corrupted files.\n",
        "\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python?\n",
        "  - file.read() reads the entire file at once, while file.readline() reads one line at a time, making it more memory-efficient for large files.\n",
        "\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for?\n",
        "  - The logging module is used to record and manage log messages for tracking events, debugging, and maintaining a record of application behavior.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling?\n",
        " - The os module allows interaction with the operating system, such as file creation, deletion, renaming, and path management.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python?\n",
        "  - Challenges include handling circular references, controlling memory leaks, and efficiently managing memory for large datasets or long-running programs.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python?\n",
        "  - An exception can be raised manually using the raise keyword followed by an exception class to signal that an error condition has occurred.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications?\n",
        "  - Multithreading allows concurrent execution of tasks, improving efficiency in I/O-bound applications and keeping programs responsive."
